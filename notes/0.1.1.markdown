* Added a plugin specific config, `Growl`, settings are now namespaced with `growl:*`

* Fixed issue with `sticky` notifications

* Broke formatters into `GroupFormatter` for test groups and `AggregateFormatter` for the summation of test results

* Now appends sbt version to library version to work across multiple version of sbt. When declaring library dependency use

    libraryDependencies <+= sbtVersion("me.lessis" %% "" % "0.1.1-%s".format(_))

*  No more auto injection of settings. Explicitly add them with

    seq(growl.GrowlingTests.growlSettings: _*)
